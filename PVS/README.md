PVS PRECiSA 
==

[PVS version 7.1](http://pvs.csl.sri.com) and the development version
of the [NASA PVS Library](https://github.com/nasa/pvslib) are required
to use the PVS development provided with the PRECiSA distribution.

To type-check and prove the PRECiSA development in PVS for the first
time, type the following
command in a Unix shell within the local directory `PVS`.

```
$ provethem 
```

The output of that command is

```
PRECiSA                  [OK: 144 proofs]

*** Grand Total: 144 proofs / 144 formulas. Missed: 0 formulas.
```


To proof-check the symbolic certificates generated by PRECiSA in
PVS, the local directory `PVS` has to be added to the Unix environment variable
`PVS_LIBRARY_PATH`.  Depending upon your shell, one of the following lines
has to be added to your startup script.  In C shell (csh or tcsh), put this line in
`~/.cshrc`, where `<precisapvsdir>` is the absolute path to the local
directory `PVS` in the PRECiSA distribution:

~~~
setenv PVS_LIBRARY_PATH "<precisapvsdir>:$PVS_LIBRARY_PATH"
~~~

In Borne shell (bash or sh), put this line in either `~/.bashrc or ~/.profile`:

~~~
export PVS_LIBRARY_PATH="<precisapvsdir>:$PVS_LIBRARY_PATH"
~~~
